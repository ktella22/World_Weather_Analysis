# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose 
This module is to help understand how to perform tasks by retrieving and analyzing data from API get requests, to store the values from JSON array, and to resolve errors messages by using try and expect blocks. Using the Matplotlib library for visualization, creating linear regreesion lines to scatter plots and adding markers using Google Maps API are the highlights in this module. 

The purpose of this challenge is to create a travel map for users based on their weather preferences to classify their vacation destinations. With the use of Google API provides the users the recommended accomendations and lodging places depends on users' ideal places. 

## Overview
In this challenge, we created a random 2000 latitude and longitude for vacation map planner. With random coordinates, we retrieved the list of nearby cities by using citipy module. OpenWeatherMap API allows us to collect the current weather conditions based on the cities that were generated. Using GoogleMaps API to visualize the maps to look at the destinations, including the hotel name, city, country and the weather conditions.
